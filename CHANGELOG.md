## [0.1.0]

First public release.

Run Slurm on Kubernetes via Slinky, declaratively, with auth-key rotation.

- Core tool implemented and covered by tests.
- `make demo` (or equivalent) runs against a synthetic backend, no special
  hardware required.
- CI runs the test suite on every push.

This is a `0.x` release: the behaviour is tested and the safety properties are
asserted, but flags and metric names may still change before `1.0.0`.
